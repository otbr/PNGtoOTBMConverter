# PNG to OTBM

A small **browser-based** tool that turns a PNG into an **OTBM** (Open Tibia Binary Map) file. Each distinct color in the image becomes a **ground tile** using the **item ID** you assign—handy for sketching map layouts from pixel art or reference images.

## Requirements

- A modern desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- No install, no build step, no backend. Everything runs locally in the page.

## Quick start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a simple static file server if your browser blocks local file access for some features).
3. Click **Import PNG** (or drag and drop) and load your image.
4. For each detected color, enter the **Tibia item ID** that should represent that color on the map.
5. Pick the **client version** that matches your OTB/dat setup (this sets OTBM/OTB version fields used by editors like RME).
6. Adjust **Z level**, **offset X/Y**, and **transparent tile ID** if needed (`0` for transparent usually means “skip”).
7. Click **Generate** and save the `.otbm` file when prompted.

Then open the file in **[Remere’s Map Editor](https://github.com/karolak6612/remeres-map-editor-redux)** or your usual Tibia mapping workflow.

## What you get

| Input | Output |
|--------|--------|
| PNG (one color ≈ one tile type) | Single-floor OTBM aligned to image pixels |

The OTBM writer targets **OTBM version 2** and builds a map sized to your image (**width × height** tiles).

## Features (short list)

- **Color list** with search; **export / import** color→ID mappings as JSON for reuse across images.
- **Simplify colors** when the image has many unique colors (merges similar shades down to a target count; max **256** mappable colors).
- **Favorites** for item IDs you use often.
- **Preview** with zoom; optional **ignore size limits** if you accept slow or heavy maps (default limits help avoid huge images in the tab).

## Limits (defaults)

These protect the browser from freezing on accidental huge inputs:

- **Max dimension:** 5000 px per side.
- **Max pixels:** about 23.5M total.
- **Colors:** up to **256** after mapping/simplification; more than that requires simplification.

Use **Ignore size limits** only when you know your machine can handle it.

## Project layout

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.html` | UI |
| `app.js` | Image handling, color detection, UI logic |
| `otbm-writer.js` | OTBM binary serialization |
| `clients-data.js` | Client ↔ OTB version data (from RME-style `clients.xml` mappings) |
| `styles.css` | Styling |
